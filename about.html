      <h2>Alpha Sigma Phi - Alpha Xi</h2>
      <p>
        The Alpha Xi chapter was founded October 29th, 1939 at Illinois Institute of Technology, and we just recently celebrated
        our 80th anniversary last year. Our brotherhood holds the 5 values of: Silence, Charity, Purity, Honor, and Patriotism.
        It is through these values that we can achieve our goal of Bettering the Man. We have helped over 1000 brothers achieve
        thier collegiate goals since we were first founded.
        Our house offers room and board to over 30 brothers, and employs a shared Chef and offers our own meal plan option
        that is much cheaper than what is offered by the school.

        <p>
          2019 was a good year for the Alpha Xi chapter. We welcomed 20 new brothers into our family, improved our house GPA,
          and renovated our basement to be updated with the ktichen we renovated a couple years back. Not only did we do well internally,
          but Externally as well. At Greek Formal our house took home Chapter of the Year. ALl of our accomplishments were being
          recognized by our peers in the greek community.
        </p>

          During the Summer of 2019, our National Headquarters held Elevate in Phoenix, Arizona. Our chapter was able to send 12 brothers
          to the leadership conference to develope skills and learn new ideas that they could bring back to improve the chapter.
          During the Cardinal and Stone Banquet our chapter was awarded a Bronze Cup for our outstanding effort the previous year.
