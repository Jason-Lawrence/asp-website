              RAINN is the the largest organization working against sexual assault. They operate the National Sexual Assault Hotline.
              Our value of Silence goes hand in hand with this organization's work as its important to listen to those who are victims.

            <p>
              Shatterproof is a national nonprofit organization working to reverse the stigma around drug addiction. They not only help
              those with addictions but support their family through the difficult time of recovery. Our value of Charity directly
              coincides with this group mission of giving help to those in need. Last September, We had 4 brothers run in Shatterproof's
              5K and able to raise $200 for their cause.

            <p>
              Active Minds is an advocate for mental health, especially for those in highschool and college.
              So many of the young generation struggle with depression, anxiety, etc, and instead of getting the help they need
              they end up suffering alone. Our value of Honor is tied to this groups work.

              "Building Homes Rebuilding Lives." That is the motto for Homes for our Troops. They build homes for veterans who were
              injured during duty. The homes they build are highly accesible and allow the veterans to regain the freedom of movement
              in their own homes. Taking care of our heroes goes along with our value of Patriotism.
