        <p>
          2019 was a good year for the Alpha Xi chapter. We welcomed 20 new brothers into our family, improved our house GPA,
          and renovated our basement to be updated with the ktichen we renovated a couple years back. Not only did we do well internally,
          but Externally as well. At Greek Formal our house took home Chapter of the Year. ALl of our accomplishments were being
          recognized by our peers in the greek community.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the Summer of 2019, our National Headquarters held Elevate in Phoenix, Arizona. Our chapter was able to send 12 brothers
          to the leadership conference to develope skills and learn new ideas that they could bring back to improve the chapter.
          During the Cardinal and Stone Banquet our chapter was awarded a Bronze Cup for our outstanding effort the previous year.
