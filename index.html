        <p>
          The Alpha Xi chapter was founded October 29th, 1939 at Illinois Institute of Technology, and we just recently celebrated
          our 80th anniversary last year. Our brotherhood holds the 5 values of: Silence, Charity, Purity, Honor, and Patriotism.
          It is through these values that we can achieve our goal of Bettering the Man. We have helped over 1000 brothers achieve
          thier collegiate goals since we were first founded.
          Our house offers room and board to over 30 brothers, and employs a shared Chef and offers our own meal plan option
          that is much cheaper than what is offered by the school.

              Shatterproof is a national nonprofit organization working to reverse the stigma around drug addiction. They not only help
              those with addictions but support their family through the difficult time of recovery. Our value of Charity directly
              coincides with this group mission of giving help to those in need. Last September, We had 4 brothers run in Shatterproof's
              5K and able to raise $200 for their cause.

              Active Minds is an advocate for mental health, especially for those in highschool and college.
              So many of the young generation struggle with depression, anxiety, etc, and instead of getting the help they need
              they end up suffering alone. Our value of Honor is tied to this groups work.

              "Building Homes Rebuilding Lives." That is the motto for Homes for our Troops. They build homes for veterans who were
              injured during duty. The homes they build are highly accesible and allow the veterans to regain the freedom of movement
              in their own homes. Taking care of our heroes goes along with our value of Patriotism.

        <p>
          2019 was a good year for the Alpha Xi chapter. We welcomed 20 new brothers into our family, improved our house GPA,
          and renovated our basement to be updated with the ktichen we renovated a couple years back. Not only did we do well internally,
          but Externally as well. At Greek Formal our house took home Chapter of the Year. ALl of our accomplishments were being
          recognized by our peers in the greek community.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the Summer of 2019, our National Headquarters held Elevate in Phoenix, Arizona. Our chapter was able to send 12 brothers
          to the leadership conference to develope skills and learn new ideas that they could bring back to improve the chapter.
          During the Cardinal and Stone Banquet our chapter was awarded a Bronze Cup for our outstanding effort the previous year.
